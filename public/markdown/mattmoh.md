## hi there,
## I am matt moh~~renweiser~~

I am a seasoned cross-functional Workday consultant with extensive experience in Prism Analytics and Accounting Center. I was the Prism Architect behind the Advanced Bonus Compensation Calculator Extend/Prism app that won Workday's inaugural Partner Innovation Award in 2020. I went on to develop the data pipeline for one of the first Accounting Center projects for a US Insurance Company. I also served as the Prism Subject Matter Expert, training other Developers on building efficient data pipelines and data models. I had the opportunity to speak at DevCon multiple times on Prism Analytics and its ability to solve complex use cases. The last presentation was on the Tipping Calculator where financial journals were split into pro-rated tips for fast-casual restaurant employees.

I am now an independent Workday consultant looking to solve unique problems within the ecosystem and to also maintain my craft.
