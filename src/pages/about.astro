				<div class="content">
					<p>
						After proudly serving over a decade in the United States Air Force, 
						I decided to pursue a career aligned with my academic background in Management 
						Information Systems and Business Management. This journey led me to Deloitte’s 
						Human Resources Transformation practice as a Workday Consultant, where I began 
						implementing HR technology projects for multinational conglomerates.
					</p>
					<p>
						Initially focusing on Recruiting, I quickly transitioned into Reporting & Analytics. 
						When Workday introduced Accounting Center, I was among the first consultants to 
						implement the product, leveraging my technical expertise to deliver transformative 
						solutions. This experience naturally evolved into a focus on Finance Transformation, 
						where I gained extensive hands-on expertise in developing scalable, efficient systems.
					</p>
					<p>
						My career further expanded as I began crafting thought leadership on agnostic 
						enterprise technology architecture tailored to the insurance industry. For 
						mid-market [re]insurers ($5B–$15B in revenue), I designed cost-conscious, 
						adaptable architectures to support growth, often leading implementations through
						 Workday. My leadership extended beyond technology, fostering collaboration across 
						 teams and ensuring projects were delivered efficiently while meeting business objectives.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside of work, I’m passionate about building people and systems in every sense. 
						I volunteer as a little league baseball coach, helping young athletes develop skills 
						and confidence, while also managing the league’s finances. This combination of mentorship 
						and operational management reflects my commitment to empowering others and creating 
						sustainable, high-performing systems.
